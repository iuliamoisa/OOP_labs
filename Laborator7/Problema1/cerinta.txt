Write two C++ literals for Kelvin and Fahrenheit conversions to Celsius so that the following code works.

int main() {

    float a = 300_Kelvin;

    float b = 120_Fahrenheit;

    return 0;

}

Organize the code in the following way:

a main file called main.cpp that contains the main function and has an example on how to use those two literals (similar to the explained in the previous main function) .
