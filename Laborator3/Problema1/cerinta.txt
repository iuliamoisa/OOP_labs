Write a class in C++ that has the following definition: 

class Math

{

public:

    static int Add(int,int);

    static int Add(int,int,int);

    static int Add(double,double);

    static int Add(double,double,double);

    static int Mul(int,int);

    static int Mul(int,int,int);

    static int Mul(double,double);

    static int Mul(double,double,double);

    static int Add(int count,...); // sums up a list of integers

    static char* Add(const char *, const char *)

}

Organize the code in the following way:

a header file called Math.h

a cpp file called Math.cpp that contains the source code for class Math

a main file called main.cpp that contains the main function and has an example on how to use Math. The example must include using all methods from the class.

for the variadic method use pointers or va_start / va_end macros.

Add(const char *, const char *) will allocate memory that can add the two existing string. If one of the strings is nullptr, this function will return nullptr;
