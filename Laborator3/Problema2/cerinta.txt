Write a class in C++ that has the following definition: 

class Canvas

{

    // add private data members

public:

    Canvas(int width,int height);

    void DrawCircle(int x, int y, int ray, char ch);

    void FillCircle(int x, int y, int ray, char ch);

    void DrawRect(int left, int top, int right, int bottom, char ch);

    void FillRect(int left, int top, int right, int bottom, char ch);

    void SetPoint(int x, int y, char ch);

    void DrawLine(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2, char ch);

    void Print(); // shows what was printed

    void Clear(); // clears the canvas

}

Organize the code in the following way:

a header file called Canvas.h

a cpp file called Canvas.cpp that contains the source code for class Canvas

a main file called main.cpp that contains the main function and has an example on how to use Canvas. The example must include using all methods from the class.

use a matrix of type char for the canvas. A pixel is a cell in the matrix. A pixel is considered empty if it contains the space (value 32) character.



For the DrawLine algorithm use Braseham algorithm.
